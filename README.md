# novavim
This is my attempt at making Vim from scratch in Go, and when I say from scratch, I mean that this project will utilize no libs outside of the Go standard library: no ncurses, no terminal UI libraries, nada - the only exceptions are libraries that I make myself.

I love Vim, so by no means am I trying to make something better - in fact, this is going to be pretty hot garbage - but nevertheless I'm going to pursue this hopeless endeavor simply because it's fun and I have no life.
